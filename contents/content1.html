       <p class="contentpara">Back in primary school, had become a digital artist (in my head). My faviourate app to
        open as soon as i start my computer was the PAINT app. i could spend hours together painting random things. 
        The one thing that was annoying was after drawing a shape i try to fill in the paint into that shape and it always
        turns out to be filled in to the entire screen, just because point mm gap was left out between the connecting lines.
