       <p class="contentpara"> There is this quote by Ernest Hemingway that says <i>"You are so brave and quiet I forgot you 
        are suffering.</i> And i think of mothers who are so brave that they won't let their child know they are suffering too,
        I see hardworking Fathers who sometimes get lonely and suffer in silence for their family. I see the people of Gaza,
        who are now suffering but their resilence to fight against the oppression makes them beautiful and strong.
       Those who are suffering wars, terrorism, those who have lost their loved ones. To all those who are silently suffering and not giving up until the end. 
       We sometimes get so indulged in our own battles that we forget that the people around us are having their own battles too, 
        Lets be Kind and not harm others either by words or actions.
        Strong can be anyone around you, you just need an open heart to look at. Strong can be YOU!
