       <p class="contentpara">During my cousin's wedding, a day before the event, I was feeling feverish. That morning, we were trying to collect some mud for planting trees. 
        In that area, a mother dog was sitting and watching her puppies play near the corner of the road. I, too, was watching them while helping my aunt collect the mud. Suddenly, a mini truck came and ran its wheels over one of the puppies. Seeing this, my mild fever worsened, and I became fuming with anger. 
        I started yelling at the driver to move the wheels off the puppy. Somehow, he stopped.
         The puppy, who had been running happily just a few seconds earlier, could no longer walk. It was struggling to move with one of its legs badly injured. I remember how desperately the mother dog ran to her puppy, barking at the driver, yelling in her own way, and licking her baby with so much pain and distress.
         I understand that not everyone is in a position to help animals, but everyone is in a position to avoid harming them.
