                  <p class="about-me">Hope you are doing well!...and if you are not, then trust me it is just time, it will pass 
                   away, you will wake up one morning surviving this bad times, becoming a bit wiser, stronger and kinder. Hold onto yourself, each day at a time.</p>
                
                 <p class="about-me"> I write sometimes, i try to capture moments through pictures, through drawings and paintings. 
                     Ofcours iam not perfect at it (i kind of messup too hehe!!!)  but i do it because i love it. 
                     so this page is about that. Also about.... (How do i explain this... oki here ill try to explain).
                     So,you know, there are moments where we are extremely happy, some moments that captures our hearts... 
                     we realise that no matter how much we love being in those moments we can't hold onto them, they slip away from our hands.
                    And we wish we could tell those moments "Please don't go."
                     Also there are moments due to the occurrence of which you become wiser and stronger or maybe broke.
                    So, there are moments we love, moments we cherish, moments we realise so many things, moments 
                    where we feel so much but cannot share, beacuse we think no one will understand us. 
                    so this blog is all about those moments.
                    hope you will enjoy.</p>
